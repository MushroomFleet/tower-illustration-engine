# Broderick Ironheart (BR0D)

## Character Description

A barrel-chested human with a perpetually sunburned face, wild auburn hair, and a beard containing various small objects he's forgotten about—now including trace amounts of glitter that refuse to be removed. Stands 6'3" but somehow seems shorter due to his perpetual slight stoop. His rugged features display a surprising thoughtfulness, with eyes that assess each situation tactically despite his preference for direct approaches.

## Clothing/Outfit Description

Wears practical plate armor modified with numerous pouches, hooks, and questionable "improvements," with recent additions inspired by his encounter with Sir Puffington III. His armor bears battle scars and dents from countless encounters, yet is meticulously maintained in functional areas. A large two-handed weapon named "Skullcrusher" is strapped to his back, with whom he maintains a conversational relationship.

## Notes on Character Essence

Broderick embodies the warrior who combines brute force with surprising tactical acumen. His visual appearance should convey both raw strength and an unexpected thoughtfulness. Key elements that define his character:

- The contrast between his imposing physical presence and his slight stoop
- The glitter contamination in his beard (aftermath of Lady Prismatica encounter)
- His elaborate pre-battle stretching routine
- His tendency to name weapons and address them in battle
- His role as the party's frontline combatant and self-appointed morale officer
