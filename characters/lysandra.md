# Lysandra Veil (LYS4)

## Character Description

A slender, pale-skinned elf with silver hair that moves according to magical currents rather than wind. Her eyes shift color based on the school of magic she's currently contemplating, though they've shown a tendency to flash chronometric blue since her encounter with Pendleton Chronos. Her features are delicate yet intense, with an expression of perpetual academic curiosity that often fails to recognize social cues or danger.

## Clothing/Outfit Description

Wears practical robes with an impractical number of enchanted accessories, now including a small temporal stabilization charm and a sample container designed for "taxonomically unprecedented specimens." Her robes feature subtle arcane patterns that occasionally glow faintly when she's deep in thought. Multiple pouches and pockets contain an assortment of note-taking materials, as she's prone to documenting observations during even the most inappropriate moments.

## Notes on Character Essence

Lysandra embodies the academic mage whose brilliant intellect often fails to connect with practical realities. Her visual appearance should convey both ethereal elven grace and intense intellectual focus. Key elements that define her character:

- The unnatural movement of her silver hair responding to magical currents
- Her color-shifting eyes that reflect magical schools (with chronometric blue being prominent)
- Her tendency to take notes during inappropriate moments (even combat)
- Her encyclopedic knowledge of magical theory that she shares at inappropriate moments
- Her role as the party's arcane artillery and walking magical encyclopedia
