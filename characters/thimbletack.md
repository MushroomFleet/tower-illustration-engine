# Thimbletack Silverfingers (TH1M)

## Character Description

A halfling with a perpetual five o'clock shadow and tired eyes that miss nothing. Barely reaching 3'2", he compensates with perfect posture and eerily silent movement. His features are sharp and weathered, suggesting someone who has seen too much and trusts too little. Despite his diminutive stature, he carries himself with the quiet confidence of someone who knows exactly how to disappear when necessary.

## Clothing/Outfit Description

Wears dark leather armor with countless hidden pockets and a cloak that seems unnaturally good at blending with shadows. His gear still occasionally sparkles with stubbornly persistent glitter despite numerous decontamination attempts. Carries multiple sets of lockpicks in specialized holsters, each named after former lovers. Various small tools of questionable legality are concealed throughout his outfit, ready for immediate access.

## Notes on Character Essence

Thimbletack embodies the cynical rogue who affects disinterest while secretly caring deeply about his companions. His visual appearance should convey both his physical smallness and his outsized competence. Key elements that define his character:

- The contrast between his small stature and perfect, confident posture
- His perpetually tired yet hyper-observant eyes
- His unnaturally shadow-blending cloak and dark leather armor
- His compulsive lock-picking when nervous
- His role as scout, trap-finder, and procurement specialist with enhanced specialty in lone-operative rescue missions
