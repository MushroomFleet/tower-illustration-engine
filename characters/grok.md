# Grok Stonefist (GR0K)

## Character Description

An orc with intelligent eyes, jade-green skin, and a methodical approach to everything. His imposing 6'8" frame is adorned with tribal patterns that are actually mathematical formulas, with a new equation tattooed on his left forearm representing the 27.3% probability calculation from the Zarathximagius mission. His features combine traditional orcish strength with unexpected scholarly precision, and he communicates as much through carefully controlled eyebrow movements as through words.

## Clothing/Outfit Description

Wears a practical combination of light armor and scholarly attire, allowing both physical mobility and quick access to his ever-present calculation journal. Carries several measuring devices, a brass abacus modified for combat calculations, and writing implements in carefully organized holders. His attire features geometric patterns that subtly echo the mathematical formulas tattooed on his skin, creating a visual harmony between his body and equipment.

## Notes on Character Essence

Grok embodies the thoughtful warrior who uses mathematics to solve problems others address with brute force. His visual appearance should convey both his physical strength and his intellectual precision. Key elements that define his character:

- The contrast between his imposing orcish physicality and his scholarly demeanor
- The mathematical formula tattoos that cover parts of his green skin
- His expression of emotions primarily through carefully controlled eyebrow movements
- His methodical organization of objects and thoughts
- His role as secondary frontline combatant and tactical coordinator with a specialty in probability calculations
